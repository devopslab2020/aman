number_1 = input("Number 1:")
print("Select an operator")
operator = (input("Operator:"))
number_2 = input("Number 2:")
print(eval(number_1 + operator + number_2))

#What eval does is that it runs the given arguments as one line in python
# EG:
#
#
#   Number 1:5
#   Select an operator
#   Operator:*
#   Number 2:5
#   25
#
#   The above are lines shown when this program runs... you'll notice that
#   eval also will put number_1, perform an arithmetic operation with operator
#   with number_2. Eval basically runs a program inside of a program!
#
#   How cool is that?!
